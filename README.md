## Overview

Project Lyrics is a dynamic webpage built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It presents a unique interactive experience with song lyrics and a music player. The project is designed with three sections:

1. **Play Icon Section:**
   - Clicking the play icon functions as a button to start playing a song.
   - Scrolls to the next page with an animated display of song lyrics.
   - Features a music player card displaying controls for mute, next, previous, play, pause, duration timer, and a progress bar.

2. **Lyrics Display:**
   - Animate through the lyrics of the selected song.
   - Accompanied by a music player card with interactive controls.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The final page displays a simple text, "The End."

## Future Additions
